          "returnPolicyText": "Aztek Computers understands that sometimes products are ordered and need to be returned.  We stand ready to help.  Please carefully read our Return Policy:\n\n**************************\n\nReturn Policy\n\nThe customer is responsible for determining if the product(s) ordered suits their needs.\n\nReturns must be requested within 30 days of the purchase date, Aztek Computers does not cross ship merchandise or refund items in transit for return.  Return requests for items reported as defective or “not as described” must be submitted within 14 days after the delivery date and said description must be part of the original return request.  Return requests for items reported as damaged must be requested within 48 hours of delivery.  Customers must allow for the carrier to claim the item from the delivery address if required by the carrier’s own policies.\n\nCustomers are responsible for return shipping except for substantiated claims of defect, damaged, or “not as described”.  In no other circumstances does Aztek Computers provide prepaid return mailing labels or reimbursement for shipping costs. The customer is responsible for ensuring the shipment arrives at the return location in the condition it was sent and described in the original return request. Returns lost in transit are the responsibility of the customer.  Aztek Computers recommends shipping insurance on items over \$100.\n\nReturns sent to Aztek Computers must be pre-approved and be issued a Return Merchandise Authorization number (RMA). Customers are not permitted to ship items back to the original shipping address without an RMA. The customer is responsible for returning the item that was authorized for return and originally purchased from Aztek Computers.  Unauthorized returns will be considered abandoned and will not be credited. The customer will be responsible for shipping charges to return the package to them.  You have 15 days to deliver the returned items.  After that time the RMA is cancelled and will not be reauthorized or reissued..  \n\nAztek Computers has a minimum restocking fee of 20%* on all returned items that are unopened and in original condition. After an order is in process it becomes a return and is handled as such. The restocking fee also applies to refused orders, orders returned due to incomplete or incorrect addresses or returned as undeliverable by the shipping company.  Aztek may also deduct from any refund the actual shipping costs, even on items that include “free shipping”.\n\n* On some select items that are damaged through use or misuse, missing parts, opened, not in the original condition, and or have obvious signs of use, Aztek Computers reserves the right to charge a higher Restocking Fee depending on the condition of the item.  \n\nSome items are not returnable directly to Aztek Computers\n\nThese are items where the manufacturer’s or third party warranty is in effect.  For example: software that has been registered or activated, where opening the package results in damage to security seals or the packaging itself, and electronic devices of any kind.\n \nIn the case of these and other items the manufacturer's remedies will need to be pursued and the manufacturer's warranties supersede any other warranties. This process saves time and money for all parties as the manufacturer is responsible for returning/replacing the warranted item.  No refunds will be issued until the warranty process is completed.  Many items, if opened, are either not returnable or may be returnable for a one-to-one replacement with the same product. The items may include software, consumables such as ink, paper, films, tape, printer cartridges, batteries, labels, blank media, bulbs and similar items.\n\n\nAll returns will be inspected and processed before providing resolution.",
